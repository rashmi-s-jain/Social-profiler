## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Features
Login, Register and Login with google.

Link facebook account to see the feeds.
Link twitter account to see the feeds. You will require a twitter username to include twitter feeds.

## Note
Not implemented Instagram feeds because individual app will not go for the review process and the review process of individual apps are stopped by instagram because of COVID-19 crises. I have tried using business account but it requires all licence certificates for the verification.

## Development server

run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

#Features
Login, Register and Login with google.

Link facebook account to see the feeds.

#Note
Not implemented Instagram feeds because individual app will not go for the review process and the review process of individual apps are stopped by instagram because of COVID-19 crises. I have tried using business account but it requires all licence certificates for the verification.
